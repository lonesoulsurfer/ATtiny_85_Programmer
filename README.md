Make your own ATtiny 85 programmer using an Arduino Nano and a custom made PCB!

I've been building a few projects of late that use a ATtiny 85 microcontrollers and wanted to create a specifically designed programmer to make the job easier.

If you are an old hand with programming ATtiny 85's or a total novice and want to learn, then this bit of kit is essential. Once you have the hardware, programming the ATtiny becomes quite simple. I did do an 'Ible on how to Program a ATtiny with an Arduino which you can find here. Note that I was only really just learing then myself and did the Ible so I wouldn't forget how to do it! However, the programmer I did make was rudimental and I wanted something more permanent.

Check out the video of the build and how to program the ATTiny 85 here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726uLVw5450&feature=youtu.be

I've also done a step by step guide on Instructables which you can find here: https://www.instructables.com/Programmer-for-ATtiny-85/
