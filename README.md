Make your own ATtiny 85 programmer using an Arduino Nano and a custom made PCB!

I've been building a few projects of late that use a ATtiny 85 microcontrollers and wanted to create a specifically designed programmer to make the job easier.

If you are an old hand with programming ATtiny 85's or a total novice and want to learn, then this bit of kit is essential. Once you have the hardware, programming the ATtiny becomes quite simple. 

Check out the video of the build and how to program the ATTiny 85 here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=726uLVw5450&feature=youtu.be

I've also done a step by step guide on Instructables which you can find here: https://www.instructables.com/Programmer-for-ATtiny-85/
